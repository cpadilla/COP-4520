COP 4520 Homework 1


I didn't get it working all the way because I couldn't figure out what's wrong with the pop operation unfortunately.

I was using C++ and the rest of the stack is implemented described in the book in chapter 11.

Build the files using g++ or a simliar c++ compiler or just run the executable.
