Dining Philosophers version 4

## Compiling

Make sure you have g++ installed on your system. Run the following command in your terminal:

```
g++ dp4.cpp
```

## Running the program

After compiling the program, an executable should be created (i.e. "a.exe"). Run this program from the command line and pass in a number of philosophers as a command line argument. Number of philosophers should be greater than 0. For example:

```
a.exe 6
```

## Proof of correctness

This version of the Dining Philosopher problem uses the same solution as version 3, but now supports a command line argument for the number of philosophers.
